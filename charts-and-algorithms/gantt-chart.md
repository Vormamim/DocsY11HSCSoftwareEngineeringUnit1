# Gantt Chart

A Gantt chart displays each of the component tasks in a proposed system development on an estimated timeline. Tasks should be named with self-explanatory titles. The estimated time required for each task and its dependent tasks should be clearly shown. The time scale should be clearly indicated with dates and important milestones in the project clearly marked.&#x20;

The following diagram shows the main elements of a Gantt chart. Other formats are acceptable:

Gantt charts can also be used to allocate resources, including team members, to specific tasks. The following chart shows the percentage completion of tasks by each team member. Charts should be regularly updated during development to reflect actual versus estimated times for tasks.
