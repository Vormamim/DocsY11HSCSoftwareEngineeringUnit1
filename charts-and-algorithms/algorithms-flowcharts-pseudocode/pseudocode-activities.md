# Pseudocode Activities

Write the following algorithms using pseudocode. Make sure you use the **exact** syntax and format  from the PDF on the previous page (INCLUDING INDENTATION!):

1. **Write the pseudocode for each of the following algorithms:**
   1.

   3.

2. **Write pseudocode algorithms for the following two scenarios:**
   1.  A customer is purchasing books from an online store. The system should:

       1. Allow the customer to enter the **price of each book**.
       2. Continue accepting book prices **until the customer types "done"**.
       3. **Calculate the total cost** of the books.
       4. **Apply a 10% discount** if the total is over **$100**.
       5. **Display the final amount** the customer needs to pay.


   2.  A system needs to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number (N). The algorithm should:

       1. Prompt the user to enter a number, N.
       2. Use a **for loop** to add all the numbers from 1 to N.
       3. After the loop finishes, print the total sum.


   3. You are creating a system that checks if a user's password is strong:
      1. The program should ask the user to enter a password.
      2. Use **one subroutine** called `CheckStrength(password)` that:
         * Ensures the password is at least **8 characters long**.
           * Checks if the password contains **at least one number**.
           * Checks if the password contains **at least one uppercase letter**.
      3. The main program should:
         * Call `CheckStrength(password)`.
           * If the password is strong, print `"Password is strong."`
           * If not, print `"Weak password. Try again."` and prompt for a new one.
