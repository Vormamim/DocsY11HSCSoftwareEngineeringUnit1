# Algorithms, Flowcharts, Pseudocode

### Algorithms

It is expected that students are able to develop and interpret algorithms represented as pseudocode and flowcharts.

It is important to start complex algorithms with a clear, uncluttered mainline. The mainline should reference required subroutines, the details of which are shown in separate algorithms.

Each subroutine should be concise and correctly make use of further subroutines for detailed logic.

For advice on designing and representing algorithms with flowcharts and pseudocode, please look through the following document. Then, complete the activities on the following pages.

## Further Explanation and Support

Whilst you are encouraged to look at the above examples and have a go as best you can, it's okay if you're a bit stuck. Whilst many covered this in Year 9 to a degree, understanding the specific syntax and terminology can be tricky.

You are of course encouraged to speak to your teacher if ever unsure.

However, if you want to practice more at home and are unsure about Algorithms, Control Structures, Pseudocode or Flowcharts, have a look through the following explanations developed by Christopher Kalodikis for Software Engineering students across the state. He has many more videos to what a linked here with more specific examples if you are feeling a bit stuck.&#x20;

Unfortunately much of his content beyond this unit are paywalled, but these videos are very thorough.
