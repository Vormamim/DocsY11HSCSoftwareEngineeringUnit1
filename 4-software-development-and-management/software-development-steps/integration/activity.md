# Activity

## **Task:**

Create two separate Python modules and integrate them so that one module calls a function from the other.

1. **Create a module called `math_operations.py`**
   * This module should have a function `add_numbers(a, b)` that returns the sum of two numbers.
2. **Create another module called `calculator.py`**
   * This module should **import** `math_operations.py` and use the `add_numbers()` function to add two numbers entered by the user.
3. **Run `calculator.py` to see the result.**
