# Debugging

Debugging is the process that comes after testing when issues or defects are identified in the software. It involves pinpointing the source of these problems within the code and making the necessary corrections to remove any bugs.

Debugging is an iterative process where developers may need to test and debug multiple times until the software is stable and performs as expected. Each cycle of testing and debugging helps refine the code, leading to a more reliable and robust software product.

Together, testing and debugging are essential for delivering high-quality software, as they help identify potential issues early, reduce the risk of failure, and enhance the overall user experience by ensuring that the software works smoothly across different environments and scenarios.
