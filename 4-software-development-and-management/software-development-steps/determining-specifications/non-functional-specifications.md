# Non-Functional Specifications

Non-functional Specifications, unlike functional ones, do not involve transforming inputs into outputs but are crucial for a software project's success.

These specifications set the development framework and affect user experience, focusing on the system's operation and performance rather than its functionality.

Non-functional specifications are from the user’s perspective in that they directly influence the standards for interface design including;

* use of menus
* use of frames to group items
* use of colour
* placement of common elements
* wording of messages and the tone of the language
* font to be used for prompts and user inputs
* size and nature of icons
