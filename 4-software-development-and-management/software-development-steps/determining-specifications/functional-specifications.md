# Functional Specifications

Functional Specifications define the transformation of input data into output information.

For instance, a functional specification might dictate that a system calculates and stores the average marks for students in each course, using raw marks and course data as input to produce average scores as output.

This transformation process, essential to the function, will be encoded into the software. Functional specifications detail the precise processing of inputs to outputs, preparing them for modelling, algorithm design, and coding in the development phase.
