# GitHub

GitHub is a "hub" (a place or platform) where people build software together as a team.

When you're using GitHub, you're also working with Git. Git is the actual version control system and GitHub is the platform where you share files and host live code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git.

Over 73 million developers use GitHub as of November 2021 and set to hit 100 million users by 2025. More companies are requiring new hires to know how to use Git and GitHub.

In team environments, Git is often used in combination with remote repositories hosted on platforms like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**. These platforms allow teams to store, share, and manage Git repositories online, providing tools for issue tracking, project management, and pull requests.

## Example Workflow in GitHub

1.  **Clone** the repository from GitHub to the local machine:

    `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`
2.  **Branch** off to work on a new feature:

    `git checkout -b feature-branch`
3.  **Commit** and **push** the changes:

    `git commit -m "Add new feature" git push origin feature-branch`
4. **Open a pull request** in GitHub, which allows team members to review the changes before merging.
