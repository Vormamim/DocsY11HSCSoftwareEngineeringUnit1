# Examples of API Usage

The task requires you to **use data from APIs** to analyse a dataset.&#x20;

These scenarios and examples contain **starter code** which could get you toward your final product. So if you are stuck for an idea, you **can** use these as a starter if you would prefer.

However, you are also welcome to **come up with your own idea** for a program. It's up to you.&#x20;
