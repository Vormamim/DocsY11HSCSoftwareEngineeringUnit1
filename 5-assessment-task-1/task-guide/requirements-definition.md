# Requirements Definition

Look at the following for guidance on what you might include in your requirements definition. Look back over the task requirements.

Essentially, you are setting goals for the following areas. Each item on the list below could have 1 or more requirements outlined in them.

**You must make sure to include functional and non-functional requirements.**

Look back at the following link for further explanation of what goes into Functional and Non-Functional requirements:

## **1. Functional Requirements** (What the system should do)

Consider the following elements when developing your functional requirements.&#x20;

* **Data Retrieval:** What does the user need to be able to view in the system?&#x20;
* **User Interface:** What is required for the user to interact with the system?
* **Data Display:** What information does the user need to obtain from the system?

## **2. Non-Functional Requirements** (How the system should work)

Consider the following elements when developing your non-functional requirements:

* **Performance:** How well does the system need to perform?&#x20;
* **Reliability:** How reliable does the system and data need to be?
* **Usability and Accessibility:** How easy to navigate does the system need to be? What instructions will we need for users to access the system?

## **Be Specific**

Your requirements definition will likely include more than the above, as you need to be **specific** in outlining the requirements of **your task** based on the **scenario you have chosen to explore.**&#x20;
