# Use Cases

We now need to create a **use case** for our **functional requirements.**

A **use case** in software development is a structured description of how a user (or system) interacts with a software application to achieve a specific goal. It defines:

* **Actors:** Who interacts with the system (e.g., user, external system).
* **Preconditions:** Conditions that must be met before the use case starts.
* **Main Flow:** The step-by-step process of how the interaction occurs.
* **Alternative Flows (if needed):** Variations or exceptions to the main flow.
* **Postconditions:** The expected outcome or result after the use case is completed.

## Example of a Use Case - Rock Collection (REQUIRED)

**Actor:** User (Geologist / Rock Nerd)

**Preconditions:** Internet access; API with rock/mineral data is available.

**Main Flow:**

1. **Search Rock/Mineral** – User enters a rock/mineral name (e.g., Obsidian, Quartz); system retrieves and displays details.
2. **Store Rock** – User adds the rock to their collection; system confirms storage.
3. **Compare Rocks** – User selects rocks; system retrieves and displays comparisons (e.g., hardness, composition, rarity).
4. **Visualise Data** – System generates a graph comparing selected rocks.
5. **Remove Rock** – User deletes a rock from the collection; system updates storage.

**Postconditions:** Rock data is retrieved, stored, compared, or removed successfully.
