# Design

Guess what ? **Diagram time!**

We need to complete a range of design documentation before we actually create our program. Yes, you may have already started coding (I understand the urge), but you need to **document** what you are doing.

{% hint style="info" %}
## **Your task requires the following:**

* **Gantt Chart** - Full time plan for Design to Maintenance phases of Project Development
* **Structure Chart -** All main routines (main()) and subroutines (functions within main()) included
* **Algorithms** - Pseudocode and Flowcharts
* **Data Dictionary -** Shows data type, size and validation of all data used in the system,
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
## PROJECT\_DEVELOPMENT.md

Remember to add **ALL** diagrams / charts into your project documentation under the heading **Design.**
