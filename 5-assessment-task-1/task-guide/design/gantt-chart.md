# Gantt Chart

You will need to complete a **Gantt Chart** for your project. This must display a time plan for completing the **Design, Development, Integration** and **Maintenance phase** of your project's development. The following is an example of what this **might** look like.

**Milestones** have been placed at the end of each development phase.

**Time Markers** have been created in a waterfall structure. Note that you may sometimes start one task before another finishes - it really depends on what you're doing. For example, GitHub commits and evaluation can continue throughout development and integration.

If you would like to create a similar one to the above, you can use this template from **Lucid Chart:**

You could also use **Google Sheets** if you would prefer - a template is here.

{% hint style="warning" %}
## **Note: It does not matter which of the above you use, or if you use them at all!**

You can use any of the above, as long as the **weeks, time markers and milestones are included.**
{% endhint %}
