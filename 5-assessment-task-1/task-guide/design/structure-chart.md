# Structure Chart

You need to create a structure chart which shows **the main routine (main() function) and all subroutines (other functions).** Likely you will not have many control variables or flags **except for the API request, which will control whether or not you can search the data.**

## Example

The following is an example of the rock collection system (not a real API by the way - but it serves for an example of what your system may look like).&#x20;
