# Commit Changes

Before pushing changes to GitHub, as you are aware, you need to **commit** these changes to the **main branch.**&#x20;

However, before you do this, you can add information to the **description.**&#x20;

This is where you will complete the questions from the previous page, as this will be your **timed evidence log** of your **testing** and how you respond to that testing. It will also demonstrate to your teacher that you have worked on your project **consistently.**&#x20;
