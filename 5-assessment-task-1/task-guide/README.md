# Task Guide

In order to complete your task, you will be working through a management process which may be familiar to you. You will be working through the **software development steps,** in a **waterfall approach.**&#x20;

Please look through these pages as you completed your assessment task in order to get a sense of **what** you need to do for each section in order to be successful.

{% hint style="warning" %}
### **Don't Overcook It!**

**Rememeber:** The goal is to complete all elements of the task, **not** to write the most complicated program to ever exist.&#x20;

Keep it simple, focus on the process rather than the final product.
