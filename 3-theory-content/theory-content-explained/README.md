# Theory Content Explained

Before we dig in to the theory, let's look at how theory content will be presented.

On your navigation bar on the left, you will see icons. Look at the following table to see what they mean:

<table><thead><tr><th width="100"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p>These pages are introductory and will have an outline of the syllabus content being covered. They basically tell you where one lesson ends and another begins. </p><p></p><p>Keep in mind that some content may take several lessons to complete, and some may not even need a whole lesson.</p></td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td>These pages contain the notes which you need to read through to understand the content.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td>These pages contain activities for you to complete (see further information below).</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td>These pages contain sample exam questions. They will be updated as we receive more materials from NESA or as this year's HSC Examination materials are released (Mid-Term 4). </td></tr></tbody></table>

## Activities

Create a **document** to complete the activities in. There will be activities for **each theory lesson** and you will need to add them and answer questions based on the content.

The document will need to be submitted to Google Classroom. It may be a Google Doc, Microsoft Word Doc or even a GitBook.

If you wish, you may also create a Git Repository for your theory work and submit them as Markdown files via a public link. It is up to you.
