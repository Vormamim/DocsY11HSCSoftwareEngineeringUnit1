# NESA Directional Verbs

Each activity will likely begin with a directional verb (e.g. describe, outline, evaluate, analyse or others). This will signal to you how to answer the question.

In senior school, we spend much time practicing our responses to questions with directional verbs, as HSC exams will always include them. It is for this reason it is important to note that NESA has specific definitions for each directional verb that may be used in an examination.

Look back to the following glossary of key words when answering questions to assist you with activities throughout the course.
