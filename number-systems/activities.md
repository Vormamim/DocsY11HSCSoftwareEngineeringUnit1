<details>

<summary>1 - <strong>Write your name in binary.</strong></summary>

1.
   1. First figure out the binary for each character using the chart on [#representing-characters](binary-systems.md#representing-characters "mention").
   2. Keep each byte (8 bits) separated by a space. For instance, "homework" would be:
      1. 01101000 01101111 01101101 01100101 01110111 01101111 01110010 01101011
   3. How many bits is your name?
   4. How many bytes is your name?

<summary>2 - Explain the benefits of using two's complement</summary>

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Explain

* Relate cause and effect.
* Make the relationships between things evident.
* Provide why and/or how.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>3 - What is -7 in 4-bit two's complement binary?</summary>



**More Thinking:** If 10 is 00001010 in an 8-bit system, what would -10 be in an 8-bit system using two's complement?

<details>

<summary>4 - How would you represent 170 in both binary and hexadecimal?</summary>

{% hint style="info" %}
## Hint

The table on the previous page[#decimal-to-hexadecimal-to-binary](using-twos-complement.md#decimal-to-hexadecimal-to-binary "mention") is missing some numbers, but you can look at the logic to work it out.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>5 - Explain how to count upwards one-by-one in binary AND hexadecimal. Provide examples to support your answer.</summary>

{% hint style="info" %}
## Hint

Look back at question 4 and how you worked it out. Consider the logic of the table on the previous page[#decimal-to-hexadecimal-to-binary](using-twos-complement.md#decimal-to-hexadecimal-to-binary "mention")  - how do you count upwards one by one?
