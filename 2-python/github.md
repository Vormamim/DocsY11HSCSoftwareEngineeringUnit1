## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaborative software development, leveraging Git. It allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code repositories, providing tools for tracking changes, reviewing code, and managing projects.

#### Key Features

* **Repositories:** Central location to store code, documentation, and other files.
* **Branches:** Enable parallel development and feature integration.
* **Pull Requests:** Facilitate code review and discussion before merging changes.
* **Issues:** Track bugs, tasks, and feature requests.
* **Actions:** Automate workflows for continuous integration and deployment.

By offering these tools, GitHub enhances collaboration among developers and supports efficient project management.
