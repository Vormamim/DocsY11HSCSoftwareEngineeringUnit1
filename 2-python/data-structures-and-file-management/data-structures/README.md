# Data Structures

When looking at structuring data, programmers have a range of tools at their disposal.&#x20;

Now, Python has its own tools such as **lists**, which are unique to the language. Whilst similar to arrays in other languages (which you will read about soon), they are **not the same**.&#x20;

* Lists can store multiple data types.
* Arrays can only store a single data type.

Then, there are tuples, sets and dictionaries for now.&#x20;

We will look at hash tables, trees and stacks later on this unit, but will start with the above for now.&#x20;
