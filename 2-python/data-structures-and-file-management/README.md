# Data Structures and File Management

{% hint style="info" %}
## Learning Intention

* Apply skills in computational thinking and programming to develop a software solution
  * using data structures
  * using standard modules
* Branching, iteration, functions
* Implementation of OOP code
  * use of control structures and data structures
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
## Success Criteria

* I can use Python’s built-in file handling functions to read data from a `.txt` file
* I can store and manipulate file data using appropriate data structures like lists or dictionaries
* I can process and analyse text file data using loops and string methods to extract meaningful information
* I can use if-else statements, loops, and functions to control program flow in Python.
* I can apply lists, arrays, tuples, sets and dictionaries to store and manage data in Python.
{% endhint %}

Let's kickstart this term with some practical Python activities to better understand data structures and file handling!
