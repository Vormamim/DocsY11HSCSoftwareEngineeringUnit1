# Learning Python

Whilst it is not a 'coding' course, you will need a certain level of skill in programming in order to complete projects and respond to exam questions throughout the course.&#x20;

We'll get to this later, but we will be using GitHub regularly in order to store and share our code. This would have been demonstrated on another page.

Now, obviously some of you will be coming into the course with different levels of skills. I have all bases covered, from those who have not used Python before all the way to those who have used it extensively.

[For **Easy, Normal and Hard modes below,** you will need to access files from this link.](https://github.com/GHS-SE-2025/Python-For-Beginners/blob/master/README.md)

To understand how to use it, read the 'README.md' file. It is common for programmers to store a README file in their GitHub repositories to explain how to access resources.

For the remainder of the modes, all resources are in the links.

## [Easy Mode: Introduction to Python Development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/intro-to-python-development/?wt.mc_id=python-c9-niner\&authuser=0)&#x20;

This is perfect if you are just starting your Python journey, or feel you need a complete refresher. These videos will show you how to setup VS Code, and will teach you Output, Data Types, Input, Conditional Statements, Loops, Functions, Modules, Packages, JSON and APIs.

## [Normal Mode - More Python for Beginners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/more-python-for-beginners/?authuser=0)&#x20;

If you already have some knowledge of Python and feel comfortable with the above, you can attempt these Microsoft tutorials. They will guide you through formatting, inheritence and classes and how to manipulate external files.

## [Hard Mode - Even More Python for Beginners (Data Tools) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/even-more-python-for-beginners-data-tools/?authuser=0)

If you already feel highly comfortable around using Python (including classes), you can have a look through these videos on how to do some Data Science with Python. This includes creating dataframes in Pandas, reading in .csv files, visualising (graphing) data with Matplotlib and even creating machine learning models!

## [Hard Mode - Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/tkinter/?authuser=0)&#x20;

As an alternative to the data tools, you could start to look into how to create a simple GUI using Python and Tkinter. Check out the attached link.

## [EXTRA SPICY MEATBALL - Flask](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flask-tutorial/)&#x20;

You've done all of that before? Feeling confident? Dive into the Flask development tutorial. Flask is used for web application development and uses Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and often an SQL database. It is not for the faint of heart, and also generally not required knowledge for this course.
